# Avaline
**Avaline** is a relatively new bot designed by a small group of developers with inspiration to improve and heighten your love and experience of [Discord](https://discordapp.com).

## Installation
~~To install **Avaline** simple click on the OAuth invite link: 
[OAuth Link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=450754650417659916&permissions=8&scope=bot)~~.\n
This bot isn't hosted on a server anymore, you will need to install this code on your own server and make a Discord Application yourself.

## Setup (Within Discord)
To setup **Avaline** on your server simply type `a!set` this will bring up an array of settings. 

To edit one of these settings, for example `welcomeEnabled` which, if enabled, sends a welcome message when a new user joins. You would type `a!set edit welcomeEnabled <true/false>`.
